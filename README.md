## Abstract:
Phishing attacks are a significant threat to online security, targeting individuals and organizations by tricking them into revealing sensitive information. This study proposes an intelligent URL phishing detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to identify and classify phishing URLs. The system extracts features from URLs and uses a supervised learning approach to train a model to detect phishing URLs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting phishing URLs with high accuracy. This system has the potential to provide real-time protection against phishing attacks and enhance online security.

Keywords: URL Phishing Detection, Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Online Security, Cybersecurity, Phishing Attack Detection.
